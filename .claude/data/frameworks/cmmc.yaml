  in_scope:
    - Systems processing CUI
    - Systems storing CUI
    - Systems transmitting CUI
    - Security protection assets
    - Assets providing security functions
  out_of_scope:
    - Systems with no CUI connectivity
    - Completely isolated networks
    - Air-gapped systems without CUI
  boundary_definition:
    - Network segmentation for CUI enclave
    - Data flow diagrams
    - System interconnection documentation

documentation:
  required:
    - System Security Plan (SSP)
    - Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
    - Network diagram
    - Data flow diagram

# Key differences from FedRAMP/GovRAMP
key_differences:
  - "Focus on CUI/FCI protection, not system authorization"
  - "Self-assessment option for Level 1 and some Level 2"
  - "Based on NIST 800-171, not NIST 800-53"
  - "Applies to contractors, not cloud services specifically"
  - "Certification is for the organization, not the system"
